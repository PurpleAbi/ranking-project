# ðŸŽ¬ Movies & Series Reviews â€” Fullstack Project

A blog-like web app built with **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**, where I share my personal reviews of movies and TV series.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure
- `client/` â†’ React frontend
- `server/` â†’ Spring Boot backend (with Flyway + MySQL)

## Running locally
### Backend
1. Make sure you have **Java 17+** and **MySQL** installed.  
2. In `server/src/main/resources/application.properties`, set your local MySQL credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_user
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
3. Run the Spring Boot app (e.g., `mvn spring-boot:run`).

### Frontend
Open the project in VS Code (or your preferred IDE).
In the terminal, navigate to the frontend folder:
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Visit the URL printed in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
